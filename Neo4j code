LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///gene-data.csv' AS row
RETURN row LIMIT 5;

#Step 1: Create Disease and Gene Nodes

// Create Disease nodes
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///gene-data.csv' AS row
MERGE (d:Disease {name: row.Disease});

// Create Gene nodes
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///gene-data.csv' AS row
MERGE (g:Gene {id: row.`Gene ID`, name: row.`Gene Name`});

#Step 2: Create Relationships

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///gene-data.csv' AS row
MATCH (d:Disease {name: row.Disease})
MATCH (g:Gene {id: row.`Gene ID`})
MERGE (g)-[:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->(d);

#Step 3: Query the Knowledge Graph

MATCH (g:Gene)-[:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->(d:Disease)
RETURN g, d LIMIT 10;

#this would give the knowledge graph for a single disease
